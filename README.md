The research code is for the numerical simulation in the submitted paper 'Koopman-Based Learning of Infinitesimal Generators without Operator Logarithm'. 

The file 'GeneratorLearning_LogFree.py' implements the proposed Koopman-Based learning method for infinitesimal generators without the use of operator logarithm. 
The results from this method are compared with those obtained using the approach detailed in 'GeneratorLearning_Mauroy-Goncalves_method.py'. 
This comparative method is described in 'A. Mauroy and J. Goncalves, “Koopman-based lifting techniques for nonlinear systems identification,” in IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, vol. 65, no. 6, pp. 2550–2565, 2019.
